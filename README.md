# Shallwe

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress** This repo is a part of a bigger project code- and knowledge- bases, which is currently undergoing open-sourcing purely for my tech practice since the discontinuation of the actual product development.

üìú **Background**  
Shallwe was to become the first Ukrainian flatmate-search platform focused on quality matches.

The project was under development in a private team, but since **July 2024** the project was put on stop with most of the documentation unfortunately lost outside of GitHub.  

Now it's going open-source mostly for technology practice and as a part of my portfolio. Some time from now it will be polished for outsider's view and deployed as a running demo with what was already implemented by July 2024.  
The rest of planned core features is very unlikely to be added, since I have more viable product ideas awaiting to be implemented.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Running the Project**  
The simplest way to run the project in development is using **Docker**.  

- Copy `.env.example` ‚Üí `.env` and provide the required variables (explanations included inside the file). 
- Run with Docker following the standard workflow.
  
_Note: you can also use Dockerfile and entrypoint as instructions for local run_

üìã **With time, I plan to**: 
- Add full documentation  
- Provide a minimal demo frontend (‚ö†Ô∏è *not* `mock_frontend`, which is only for the most basic manual tests)  
- Deploy and run in AWS

There is no strict timeline for this, since it's used as a sandbox of relatively complex codebase to experiment with technology I want to gain a better grasp of.
